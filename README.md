# Project Overview
This project is a simple and efficient web page designed to calculate the total price of products listed in a CSV file. The project's primary purpose is to demonstrate how to load a CSV file using JavaScript, parse its contents, and perform a calculation based on that data. This project can be utilized in various contexts, such as inventory management systems, e-commerce platforms, or any application that requires the parsing and calculation of CSV data. The context of this project assumes the user has a CSV file named 'products.csv' and the file contains product names and their corresponding prices. The calculated total price of the products is then presented to the user in a user-friendly format.

# Requirements
The project has several critical requirements that must be met for successful execution:
1. A CSV file named 'products.csv' must exist in the same directory as the HTML file.
2. The CSV file must be in the format `product,price` with each product and its price listed on a new line.
3. The total price of all products must be correctly calculated and displayed on the web page.

# Installation & Setup
To set up and run the project, you need a modern web browser that supports ES6 syntax (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Follow these steps to setup:
1. Save the provided 'index.html' file to your desired location on your computer.
2. Ensure you have a file named 'products.csv' in the same directory as your HTML file. This file should contain your products and their prices.
3. Open the 'index.html' file in your web browser.
4. The total price of your products will be displayed on the webpage.

# Usage Instructions
Using the application is straightforward. Once you've followed the setup instructions, simply open the 'index.html' file in your web browser. The webpage will automatically fetch and read the 'products.csv' file, calculate the total price of the products, and display the result on the screen.

# Technical Details
The application is built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code fetches the 'products.csv' file, reads its content, and splits it into rows based on the newline character. Each row is then split into columns based on the comma character. The second column (which represents the price of the product) is parsed into a floating-point number and added to the total. The final total is then displayed on the webpage. The JavaScript code also includes error handling to catch and log any errors that may occur during the fetch or calculation process.

# Troubleshooting
If the total price isn't displayed, check the following:
1. Ensure the 'products.csv' file is in the same directory as the 'index.html' file.
2. Make sure your CSV file is formatted correctly. It should follow the `product,price` format with each product and its price listed on a new line.
3. Check the console log for any error messages.
